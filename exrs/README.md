# exrs (extended rust)

The idea behind this crate is to add utilities that should exist in normal Rust (in my opinion), but don't right now. This crate only houses the `variants` macro for now. I think it will end up collecting other functions, structs, and macros, but if it doesn't, I may move or rename it.
